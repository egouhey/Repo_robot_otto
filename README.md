## 📄 This project in short

This project is the first electronics project I have completed. It was inspired by the open-source Ottodiy project. However, I decided to start from scratch : I redesigned my own 3D parts with Onshape, designed and assembled the electronics, and rewrote the code on Arduino IDE.

## 🚀 Quickstart

Here you will find links to the different parts of the project:
